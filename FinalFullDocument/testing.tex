\chapter{System  and Unit Testing}

This section describes the approach taken with regard to system and unit testing. 

\section{Overview}
The testing approach for this project was a bit different from traditional software testing. We did not have an automated testing framework to run unit tests or regression tests, instead we verified visually when a piece of the project was behaving as expected. This project used many off the shelf hardware and software products where testing the functionality of these pieces has already been done by the manufacturer of that technology. The tests described below allowed us to evaluate whether or not the different subsystems of the UAV were functioning correctly.

\section{Dependencies}
There were no testing frameworks used for this project. All testing was verified manually.


\section{Test Setup and Execution}
\subsection{Testing: U-1}
\textbf{As a user, I want to communicate the waypoints to the UAV.}\\
\begin{tabular}{| c | >{\raggedright}m{4cm} | m{4cm} | c |}\hline
	Task No. & Task & Test\\\hline
	3 & Modify mission communication implementation as necessary & User is able to create mission file with ground control station.\\\hline
	3 & Modify mission communication implementation as necessary & User is able to load mission file on offboard(ODroid).\\\hline
	3 & Modify mission communication implementation as necessary & Landing Algorithm on offboard starts after completing last mission.\\\hline
