\item SPRINT 1

\item [9/14/15]  Began looking into original code. \hfill{Jon Dixon}

\item [9/21/15]  Ran original code with landing pad target from the robotics lab. Code was able to detect the three blobs, and give what appeared to be an accurate distance reading in centimeters. \hfill{Jon Dixon}

\item [9/28/15]  Understood legacy vision code and was able to develop an idea of a plan for future sprints. \hfill{Jon Dixon}

\item SPRINT 2

\item [10/19/15]  Continued working with legacy vision code. Determined a plan of attack - find the angle of the target so that we can detect orientation. \hfill{Jon Dixon}

\item [10/26/15]  Continued with attempt to add orientation sensitivity, but not making any real progress. \hfill{Jon Dixon}

\item SPRINT 3

\item [11/9/15]  Developed a plan of attack to change from a three blob approach to blob detection to a four blob approach. This idea was prompted by the computer vision class, as we were taught that for full-blown homography it helps to have four known features to use for the math. \hfill{Jon Dixon}

\item [11/16/15]  Worked with Julian to develop a new landing target that would have four colored blobs instead of three. \hfill{Jon Dixon}

\item [11/23/15]  After playing with legacy code and attempting to make it work for the new four blob system, Julian and I determined that we had no idea how to actually go from a homography matrix to an orientation angle. \hfill{Jon Dixon}

\item[11/23/15] Began work and research with other vision tracking systems. One potential option is using hough transforms to search for circles in an image, since circles are going to be relatively uncommon in nature. Began research on QR/AR tag tracking libraries. \hfill{Jon Dixon}

\item SPRINT 4

\item SPRINT 5

\item [2/15/16]  Installed the AR\_Track\_Alvar ROS package, but had no results when trying to actually run it. \hfill{Jon Dixon}

\item [1/25/16]  Worked with Dylan Geyer to get Alvar working, and removed the GUI so that we were only receiving values that we would actually need.  \hfill{Jon Dixon}

\item SPRINT 6
