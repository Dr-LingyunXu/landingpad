\item SPRINT 4

\item [1/18/16] Got an ALVAR environment set up in Ubuntu 14.04 using an image stream from the webcam on the school laptop. ALVAR sample programs build and run successfully, but note that there is no ROS implementation in the raw ALVAR source.  \hfill{Dylan Geyer}

\item [2/1/16]  Non-ROS version of ALVAR is able to see AR Tags and estimate their pose. This information is stored as 3 translation variables(x,y,z) and 4 quaternian terms. Future implementations could bundle this data into a ROS Message but for now it is just printed to the terminal. \hfill{Dylan Geyer}
