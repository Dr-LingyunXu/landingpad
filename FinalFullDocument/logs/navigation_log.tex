\item [10/03/15]  Tested ardupilot with windows. Could not get landingpad ardupilot to connect, but was able to get Robotics Team ardupilot to work with windows. Also was able to get this ardupilot connected in Ubuntu and working with MavRos. \hfill{Chris Smith}

\item [11/16/15]  QGroundControl installed and working...maybe. The linux side install seems to be a bit more problematic (some crashing and buttons not loading properly). Windows side install went smoothly, seems to work just fine. Able to generate mission files using either side.  \hfill{Steven Huerta}

\item [12/21/15]  QGroundControl is incredibly frustrating to use to calibrate the pix on the linux side. Unable to complete the calibration for some reason, some information is not getting updated and preventing the final calibration from being completed. This has required walking through the calibration from the beginning each time.  \hfill{Steven Huerta}

\item [1/4/16]  Pixhawk is calibrated and working with QGroundControl. We have some motor tests to complete and then we are ready to fly. \hfill{Steven Huerta}

\item SPRINT 4

\item [1/18/16]  UAV flying under manual control, ready to test autonomous flight soon. \hfill{Steven Huerta}

\item [1/25/16]  UAV performed beautifully. Recent outdoor tests confirm that the pixhawk is able to execute waypoint navigation missions. We discovered after a few flights that one of the rotor arms was twisting, and the flight controller was able to compensate for this and still fly accurately. We had consistent results of less than a few feet when the flight controller was given the same point to take off from and land on. Very surprising and we may be able to modify our landing approach.  \hfill{Steven Huerta}
