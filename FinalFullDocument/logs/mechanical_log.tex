\item SPRINT 1

\item [9/14/15]  Started to look at compenents for UAV. \hfill{Chris, Dylan, Jon, and Steven}

\item [9/21/15]  Compenents for UAV were not in a usable state so new components needed to be looked at for ordering. \hfill{Chris, Dylan, Jon, and Steven}

\item [9/28/15]  Components decided on for ordering for new hex rotor UAV. \hfill{Chris, Dylan, Jon, and Steven}

\item SPRINT 2

\item [10/12/15]  Components were ordered and waiting on arrival \hfill{Steven Huerta}

\item SPRINT 3

\item [11/9/15]  Received the Turnigy Talon Hexcopter and got the frame put together. \hfill{Dylan Geyer}

\item [11/11/15] Attached the 6 DC Motors and Electronic speed controllers to each arm of the frame. Noted that there may not be enough room on the base plate of the hexcopter to mount two GPS modules a flight controller and an ODroid. Possible looking at 3D Printing a larger center plate to attach all of the arms to. I burned my fingers a lot trying to solder the ESC's to the motors.

\item SPRINT 3.5

\item [12/28/15]  New base plates for craft was printed and assembled. There is now plenty of room for GPS stands, Flight Controller, and ODroid. Printed base plates are temporary until carbon plates can be made.  

\item SPRINT 4

\item SPRINT 5

\item SPRINT 6
