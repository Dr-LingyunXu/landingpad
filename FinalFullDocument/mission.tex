\section{Mission Statement}
The purpose of this project is to develop a method to enable a small multi-rotor UAV to autonomously take-off, navigate to assigned waypoints, and land accurately on a landing pad to recharge its battery.

\section{Elevator Pitch}
Small multi-rotor UAVs provide the ability to quickly survey a large area over difficult terrain, and remain a small investment relative to other larger UAVs. The downside is the short battery life, which can be overcome by implementing an autonomous landing method that will land accurately and with the correct orientation so as to make recharging possible. Our team is working towards that autonomy so that small UAVs can be deployed again and again from a recharging station.
