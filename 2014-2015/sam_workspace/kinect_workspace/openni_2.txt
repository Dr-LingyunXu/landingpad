Hello all,

I found that all you needed to get the Asus Xtion Pro up and running with ROS was to use the following command
$ sudo apt-get install ros-<ros_version>-openni2-launch
For me in the Indigo version of ROS the command was 
$sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-openni2-launch
This will install the packet to ROS so you can call it. Once installed to see results use
$ roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch
Open a new terminal and type
$ rosrun rviz rviz
You should be able to see some output. Note: if you are using the Xtion Pro instead of the Xtion Live Pro
you will only see white dots.
