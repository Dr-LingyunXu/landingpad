Black Hills Power UAV team
Second Semester
Goals: 
Swarm Deployment 
Powerline Survey
Drones are in strategic locals to deploy from offices to survey lines within area

Team Focus: 
6 MEs, 1 CENG

Building portable weather proof enclosure: self closing, self-opening, charging
Drone House
Self-sustaining
 
Filing intent to disclose - field deployable UAV box

Issue: Initial budget 10K
Ordered two drones
DJI - Phantom Drones
DJI - Telementry Link

NEED: Set a GPS location fly course and return

- Real test +/- 15 meters, 

requires Visual Landing System

DISCUSSION: 
Can we get other than visual

Has already been done before - But controlled by motion capture

Makes sense to be done by the base station - Adding to the drone, adds to issue of payload and tof

Need to find a way to get video feed to where we need to land it.

Bluetooth control

Milehigh Wings - USB to X transmitters - enable transmitter to take control of drone (programmable)

Move drone into position

DJI phantoms have wifi (Phantom II)

Video Feed - DJI has screen connection through control unit. 

Have Go-pro gimbal on drone

issue command to gimbal to flip video to control landing

use led on UAV and camera on station to guide UAV

finding platform from drone will be easier than other way around.

Use increasingly smaller markers (Use APR tag OR AR tag)

4'X 4' with 2' wings and 4' pyramids Use colored lights(G at furthest, R at nearer, B at nearest)

Write homeographic warping algorithm - april tags lab Michigan

Patent on drone enclosure. What type of drone doesn't matter. 

Matt Sydell from BHP will be at CDR. Possible source of funding.

Monday 8AM - Landing Meeting - Hardrock Room - Surbeck


VISION: 

Lights - White in center.

Look at homography: Understand distances from warping

Use of triangle
