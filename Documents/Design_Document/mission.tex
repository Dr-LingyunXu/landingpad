\section{Mission Statement}
Our project is concerned with the autonomous capability of a UAV to take-off, navigate through a series of waypoints, and return to the landing pad to successfully land within +/- .1 meters and with the correct orientation to the landing pad.\\

\section{Elevator Pitch}
The capability of UAVs to rapidly search a large area, especially one that is difficult to traverse by foot or vehicle, would be invaluable to operations such as search \& rescue. However, small UAVs have a very limited flight time. A system incorporating a UVG equipped with a landing pad that also serves as a charging station would allow the UAV to be delivered to areas of limited access. The UAV could then, being provided with waypoints by the user, autonomously take-off, and navigate through the waypoints. After moving through the waypoints, or when the UAV requires recharging, the UAV will return to the UVG and safely land in such a way that the charging unit can connect to the UAV. Our goal is to provide or enable this autonomy for the UAV.
