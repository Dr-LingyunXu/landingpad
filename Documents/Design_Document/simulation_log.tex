\item [9/26/15]  Installed Ubuntu LTS, ROS Jade, and Gazebo5 \hfill{Chris Smith}
\item [10/3/15] Went through tutorials on using Gazebo and Ros Jade. \hfill{Chris Smith}
\item [10/9/15] Installed Rotors-Simulator for ROS and Gazebo. \hfill{Chris Smith}
\item [10/15/15] Worked on Gazebo Simulation with Rotors-Simulator. \hfill{Chris Smith}
\item [11/14/15] Worked on integrating waypoint passing with Pix4 SITL simulation.\\
First attempt: Attempted to create a waypoint publisher to pass waypoints via ROS. Abandoned this method when waypoint file loader was found in Mavlink documentation.\\
Second attempt: Attempted to utilize waypoint file loader to pass a file of waypoints and instructions to simulated UAV. Abandoned this method when we were unable to connect to MavROS implementation. Calling waypoint loader method would result in communication error.
Third attempt: Attempted to use a different simulation of PixHawk and UAV in order to implement file loading. Abandoned after many unsuccessful attempts to load waypoint files.\\

\item [11/14/15] Continued working on simulation waypoint passing. Returning to original conceived method of creating a waypoint publisher node to pass waypoints from a file to the simulated PixHawk.\\
